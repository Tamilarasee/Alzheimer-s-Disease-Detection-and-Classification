        "Gradient descent is used to find the appropriate values of the parameters (theta) such that we get a minimum possible cost function in a machine learning algorithm. In order to bring the paramerters closer to the appropriate value, we update the parameters based on the product of the gradient descent value and a learning parameter. Whie gradient descent which is the slope of the cost curve helps to determine the direction (+ve/-ve) in which we should update our parameters, the learning rate determines how big/small (size) is the step in that direction determined by GD.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning rate helps to know the scale at which the parameter gets varied at every update. If the learning parameter is too low, then we take very small steps towards the minimum cost and hence we reach the minimum value very slowly and we might not even reach the minimum if we have less number of epochs/iterations of update. So, it may need more time (slower convergence) and a large number of epochs to reach the minimum. We may also get stuck at the local minimum instead of reaching the global minimum because once we are in th eminimum, GD does not provide any direction and does not let us move further.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the learning parameter is too high, then we take very big steps(overshoot) that we might jump around the minimum cost but may not reach the minimum cost as we keep varying the parameters and the value updates on larger scale in the alternate directions given by GD and hence we may never reach the minimum value leading to divergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is always better to have an optimal value of learning rate which can be found by triail/error method or other dynamic techniques so that we reach(converge) the minimum cost at appropriate pace (possibly faster).\n"

        "1. The Stochastic gradient descent is a method in which we update the parameter value after reviewing a randomly chosen single sample point at a time.\n",
        "2. Batch/vanilla gradient descent is a method which gets the feedback of all the training samples before it makes a direction decision to move. It reviews all the samples and then deicides the direction to move which is given to the parameter update rule for every step/update. This slows down the process of moving towards the minimum and take more time.\n",
        "3. In Stochastic gradient, as soon as we see a random training sample, the parameter is updated based on the feedback of this sample and then from the next updated step, a different random sample is used to direct the learning of the model. This randomness helps to explore the nature of the training samples and ensures that it doesnt get stuck at local minimum. \n",
        "4. Since we see one sample at a time, we may avoid overfitting the model thereby a new testing data could be efficiently predicted in this model.\n",
        "5. Although this approach of stochastic GD may result in random/wild oscillations of the direction, it would definetly progress towards the minimum cost since we choose samples differently each time and the progress is faster than the Batch GD.\n",

        "Thus stochastic GD is needed to converge faster (reach the minimum cost) by taking less time to decide the direction of the path especially for larger training sets."
